## Commands

```shell
lemmego run migrate up          # apply everything pending
lemmego run migrate down        # roll back
lemmego run migrate status      # what has run and what has not
lemmego run migrate create -n create_users_table
```

Each of `up` and `down` takes `--step` (`-s`), and each of the three takes
`--driver` (`-d`) and `--dsn` (`-u`) to point at a database other than the
one the application is configured with.

## What `--step` counts

**Migrations, on both commands.** `--step 2` on `down` reverts the two most
recently applied migrations.

With no `--step`, `down` reverts the whole of the latest batch — everything
applied by the most recent `migrate up`. On a project whose schema went up in
one command, that is the entire schema, so prefer an explicit `--step` unless
you mean it.

```shell
lemmego run migrate down --step 1    # the last migration
lemmego run migrate down             # the last batch
```

## One transaction per run

`up` opens a single transaction, runs every pending migration inside it, and
commits once — with a 30-second budget for the whole run. A failure anywhere
rolls back the entire run; there are no savepoints between migrations. `down`
works the same way.

This is what makes a failed deploy leave a schema that is either entirely
before or entirely after, and what makes
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` impossible — see
[The whole batch is one transaction](/docs/migrations/writing-migrations#the-whole-batch-is-one-transaction).

## How it works

1. `Init()` creates the `schema_migrations` table if it is absent.
2. Migrations already recorded there are marked done in memory.
3. `up` applies the pending ones in version order and records them against a
   new batch number.
4. `down` reverts in reverse version order — a number of migrations, or the
   latest batch.

## Pointing at another database

The `--dsn` flag is how you run migrations against a scratch database, which
is the cheapest way to check that a migration is reversible before it reaches
anything you care about:

```shell
createdb myapp_scratch
lemmego run migrate up   -u "postgres://user@localhost:5432/myapp_scratch?sslmode=disable"
lemmego run migrate down -u "postgres://user@localhost:5432/myapp_scratch?sslmode=disable"
dropdb myapp_scratch
```

Up, down, and up again on a throwaway database catches the two failures a
review does not: a down that leaves a table behind because something still
references it, and an up that only works on an empty schema.

## Which database migrate connects to

`migrate` resolves its DSN in this order, taking the first that is set:

1. `--dsn`
2. `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`
3. `DATABASE_URL`
4. the `DB_*` components — `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`,
   `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_PARAMS`

A present-but-empty variable is treated as absent, so a stray line in a `.env`
does not shadow the next source.

Note `DB_PARAMS` is **separate** from the `options` map in
`internal/configs/database.go` that the application reads. `lib/pq` defaults to
`sslmode=require`, so a local PostgreSQL needs `DB_PARAMS=sslmode=disable` in
`.env` or migrations will fail to connect while the application itself is fine.

### Never migrate through a connection pooler

`DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` is checked first, and the ordering matters.

Managed providers such as Neon and Supabase publish two URLs for one database:
a pooled one fronted by PgBouncer in transaction mode, and a direct one. Their
quickstarts point you at the pooled URL, so that is usually what ends up in
`DATABASE_URL` — and it is the wrong endpoint for a migration, twice over.

`lib/pq` issues every parameterised query on the *unnamed* prepared statement
over the extended protocol. Under transaction pooling a `Parse` from one
logical connection can pair with a `Bind` from another, and the migrator's own
bookkeeping queries are parameterised. So a schema change can fail partway
through a deploy, reporting a statement nobody wrote:

```text
pq: bind message supplies 2 parameters, but prepared statement "" requires 1
```

It is intermittent, happens in both directions, and can leave a schema
half-changed.

Pooled connections are also session-less by design, so anything a migration
does that outlives a single statement — an advisory lock, a `SET`, a
session-scoped temp table — applies to whichever backend answered rather than
to the migration.

Set both variables and the right endpoint is chosen for you:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...-pooler.../db?sslmode=require
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgres://.../db?sslmode=require
```

An explicit `--dsn` still wins, including when you deliberately want the pooled
endpoint.
