## Overview

Lemmego applications compile to a single binary, making deployment straightforward across any platform that supports Go.

## Production Build

### Build the Application

```shell
go build -o bin/app ./cmd/app
```

### Build Frontend Assets

```shell
lemmego build
```

This runs `templ generate` (if needed) and `npm run build` / `pnpm build` for production frontend assets.

## Production Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these for production:

```shell
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_PORT=8080
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Database
DB_CONNECTION=postgres
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_DATABASE=your-db-name
DB_USERNAME=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password

# Session — see "Sessions on a container platform" below
SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_COOKIE=your_app_session

# Filesystem
FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
AWS_BUCKET=your-bucket

# Encryption
APP_KEY=base64:your-32-byte-key

# Auth (if using JWT)
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### Sessions on a container platform

`SESSION_DRIVER` above is `database` rather than `redis`, which is worth
explaining because the wrong choice here is invisible until you deploy.

Of the four drivers, only three are durable, and two of those cost you
infrastructure:

| Driver | Survives a deploy? | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `memory` | **No** | nothing |
| `file` | Only with a mounted volume | a volume that outlives the container |
| `redis` | Yes | a Redis service |
| `database` | Yes | a `sessions` table |

On a platform where containers are replaced on every deploy, `file` **without
a mounted volume behaves like `memory`**: the store lives in the container
filesystem and dies with it, so every deploy signs out every user. That failure
is quiet — nothing errors, people are simply logged out — so it is easy to ship
and hard to attribute.

If you already run a database, `database` is the cheapest durable answer. See
[Session → Database](/docs/session#database) for the table and the one
provider-ordering requirement.

### Managed Postgres and connection poolers

Managed providers such as Neon and Supabase publish **two** URLs for one
database: a pooled one fronted by PgBouncer in transaction mode, and a direct
one. Their quickstarts point you at the pooled URL.

**Do not run migrations through the pooled URL.** `lib/pq` issues every
parameterised query on the *unnamed* prepared statement over the extended
protocol, and under transaction pooling a `Parse` from one logical connection
can pair with a `Bind` from another. The symptom is intermittent and reads like
a bug in your code:

```text
pq: bind message supplies 2 parameters, but prepared statement "" requires 1
```

The failure is intermittent and can leave a schema half-changed. Pooled
connections are also session-less by design, so an advisory lock, a `SET`, or
a session-scoped temp table applies to whichever backend answered rather than
to your migration.

`migrate` resolves its DSN in this order:

1. `--dsn`
2. `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`
3. `DATABASE_URL`
4. the `DB_*` components

So set both and the right endpoint is chosen for you:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...-pooler.../db?sslmode=require
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgres://.../db?sslmode=require
```

An explicit `--dsn` still wins, including when you deliberately want the pooled
endpoint. A present-but-empty `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` does not shadow
`DATABASE_URL`.

The same applies to the application itself if it uses `lib/pq`: put the pooling
in `database/sql`, which already holds connections open, and point the app at
the direct endpoint.

### Health checks

`api` ships a health checker and three handlers, and **registers no routes** —
mounting them is the application's job. A project from `lemmego new` does it in
`internal/routes/health.go`:

| Endpoint | Answers | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `/livez` | the process is running | an orchestrator, to restart the container |
| `/readyz` | this instance can serve traffic | a load balancer, to take it out of rotation |
| `/health` | every check, including non-critical ones | a person or a scraper |

The split matters. A liveness probe must not depend on anything external — one
that fails when the database blinks will restart every instance of a healthy
application. A readiness probe checks the critical dependencies and nothing
else. `/health` is where a non-critical degradation shows up.

That is what `Critical` on a check decides:

```go
checker := a.GetHealthChecker()
checker.RegisterDefaultChecks()   // filesystem (non-critical), session (critical)

checker.RegisterCheck("database", app.HealthCheck{
    Name:        "database",
    Description: "The application's database answers",
    Critical:    true,
    Timeout:     3 * time.Second,
    CheckFunc: func(ctx context.Context) error {
        conn, ok := db.Resolve(a)
        if !ok || conn == nil {
            return errors.New("no database is registered")
        }
        return conn.SQLDB().PingContext(ctx)
    },
})
```

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **`RegisterDefaultChecks` covers only the filesystem and the session store.**
  A database check is yours to add, and it is the one that makes `/readyz`
  meaningful.
- **Make it a real round trip.** A pool holding a connection object and a
  server that has gone away look identical until something asks. `db.Resolve`
  rather than your ORM's own handle keeps the check the same across connectors.

Register nothing and the endpoints answer `healthy` having verified nothing,
which is a green light wired to no sensor.

### Graceful Shutdown

The framework supports graceful shutdown via `ShutdownProvider`:

```go
type MyProvider struct{}

func (p *MyProvider) Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Close database connections, flush logs, etc.
    return nil
}
```

## Deployment Options

### Single Binary

```shell
# Build for your target platform
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/app ./cmd/app

# Deploy the binary and public/ directory
scp bin/app user@server:/opt/app/
scp -r public user@server:/opt/app/
scp .env user@server:/opt/app/
```

### Docker

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN make build && go build -o bin/app ./cmd/app

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/bin/app .
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.env .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./app"]
```

### Process Manager

Use a process manager like supervisor or systemd:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Lemmego App
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/opt/app
ExecStart=/opt/app/app
Restart=always
EnvironmentFile=/opt/app/.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Reverse Proxy

For production, run behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    location /build/ {
        alias /opt/app/public/build/;
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
}
```
