## What is the Lemmego ORM?

The **Lemmego ORM** is a SQL persistence layer built directly on `database/sql`. It is the default for new projects created with `lemmego new`.

It stands alone. Its only dependencies are `database/sql` and two small naming libraries, shared with the CLI and migration modules so that table names agree. It imports no other Lemmego package, and nothing about it requires the framework:

```go
sqlDB, _ := sql.Open("pgx", dsn)
db := orm.Open(sqlDB, orm.Postgres())
```

That is the whole setup.

### Supported databases

PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. Every feature documented in this section is exercised against all three on each test run.

## ORM or GPA?

Both ship with the framework, and they are not rivals.

| | Lemmego ORM | [GPA](/docs/database/) |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | SQL only | SQL, MongoDB, Redis, and more |
| API | Query builder with relationships | Uniform `Repository[T]` per backend |
| Relationships | `hasOne`, `hasMany`, `belongsTo`, many-to-many | Preload by name |
| Best for | A SQL application you want to write SQL-shaped code against | Code that must run across storage engines |

If you want both, [`gpaorm`](/docs/orm/gpa-adapter) implements the GPA contracts on top of the ORM, so code written against `gpa.Repository[T]` runs on it unchanged.

## Installation

A project scaffolded with `lemmego new` already has it. To add it by hand:

```bash
go get github.com/lemmego/orm
go get github.com/lemmego/ormconnector   # wires it into the app lifecycle
```

Register the connector in `bootstrap/providers.go`:

```go
func LoadProviders() []app.Provider {
    return []app.Provider{
        &fs.Provider{},
        &session.Provider{},
        &ormconnector.Provider{},
        // ...
    }
}
```

The connector reads the same `sql` configuration the other connectors read, opens the connection, and publishes `*orm.DB` to the service container:

```go
db := app.Get[*orm.DB](a)   // or ormconnector.Get(a)
```

It builds its DSN with the migration module's own `DataSource` and derives the ORM dialect from the same driver name, so the ORM and `lemmego migrate` always resolve the same database.

## A first query

```go
type User struct {
    ID        int       `orm:"primaryKey;autoIncrement"`
    Email     string    `orm:"column:email_address"`
    Active    bool
    CreatedAt time.Time
    UpdatedAt time.Time
    Posts     []Post    `orm:"hasMany:UserID"`
}

users, err := db.Model[User]().
    Where(orm.Eq("active", true)).
    With("Posts").
    OrderBy(orm.Desc("created_at")).
    Limit(20).
    All(ctx)
```

`Model[T]` and `Raw[T]` are generic **methods**, available on both `*orm.DB` and `*orm.Tx`, so a transaction is a drop-in replacement for the connection.

## Conventions

- **Table names** come from the model name: snake_case, then pluralised. `Category` becomes `categories`. This is the same pipeline the CLI and migration modules use, so a model and a generated migration agree. Implement `TableName() string` to override.
- **Column names** default to the snake_case field name. `orm:"column:email_address"` overrides.
- **Primary keys** are declared with `orm:"primaryKey"`, and `autoIncrement` marks a generated key so it is written back to the entity after insert.
- A `db:"..."` tag is honoured as a fallback, so models generated before the ORM existed map without edits.
- Fields that cannot round-trip through a single column — nested structs, slices of structs — are skipped rather than mapped.
